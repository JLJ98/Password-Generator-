# Password-Generator-

## Description

My movtivation for this project was to create a random password generator for an employee with access to sensitive data.
This will help create a strong password that provides greater security.
I learned the basics of javascript including arrays, for loops, if statements, how to define a variable, and how to generate random numbers.


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this password generator, simply go the website and click "Generate Password." 
Once you have done that you will be prompted with questions regarding what kind of characters you would like in your password.
Simply press "OK" if you would like those charcters or "Cancel" if you don't want those characters.
Once you have answered all the questions you will be prompted with a password.
